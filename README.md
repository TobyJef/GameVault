Welcome to GameVault. Our aim is to provide a quality website and reliable shopping service for not only gamers but those shopping for their gaming obsessed friends and loved ones. GameVault offers a variety of Games, Consoles and Gaming Accessories.

Visitors to the GameVault website can search and browse our range of products. Or for those that know what they want, filter their product searches or jump straight to their preferred categories from the navbar. The navbar main categories are based on our supported console brand i.e Playstation, Nintendo etc, our shoppers are looking to purchase for, then further expanded into sub categories including consoles, game genres and accessories. Shoppers can add their purchases to the basket which relays a live cost total so they can keep track of their spending before checking out and purchasing their desired items. GameVault also provides our site browsers and customers the opportunity to sign up to our mailing list so they can recieve future communications from us regarding new game and console releases and sale events.

This project, is for a fictitous video game business to consumer e-commerce site of my own design. It is designed to allow customers to browse a range of video game related stock, add their desired purchases to a basket and later check out and purchase the chosen products. Create and log into a customer account, and if they so desire sign up to the GameVault sites mailing list. It will also allow for the business owner to log into the website as the super user, to manage their stock inventory, descriptions and images.

## User Experience

### Strategy Plane

The primary site goal of GameVault, is to serve as a business to consumer website for a video game retailer. GameVault offers its customers a selection of video games and gaming accessories across all modern gaming consoles. Product inventory is categorised by console and sub categories such as genre. Customers can use the search bar to look for specific items and filter products searches further by price and rating. Products images are displayed to help customers, who may not be confident when shopping for gaming related products to make the correct purchase for a friend or loved one. A basket with a live total is displayed to show the current total to help ensure customers towards sensible spending. Something that can be helpful for those who struggle with impulsive online purchases.

## Business Plan

- Mission Statement:

GameVault aims to provide gamers and those shopping for their gamer obsessed loved one an easy to use all in one platform for purchasing the latest video games, consoles and accessories. Supporting all the major console platforms and competitively priced against our competitors such as Game, GameStop and Amazon to name a few. While GameVault is currently in its infancy, our product range only currently focuses on selling physical copies of video games, and can not be as great as our competition. However we desire to eventually grow and expand our product ranges and customer base and then cater to those looking to purchase digital copies of games, PC games, gaming merchandise, toys, collectibles and trading cards. We also aim to allow our customers set up pre-orders and get GameVault into the second hand video game market and offer to competition to the likes of eBay and Cex.

- Target Market: 

Casual and hardcore gamers, collectors, and gaming enthusiasts focusing mainly on the UK market but offering international shipping and delivery to Europe and North America.

- Business Objectives:

Establish a foothold within the UK gaming retail market, last vauled in 2023 at Â£7.82b up 4.4% from 2022. As per the report published April 2024 from 
[UK Interactive Entertainment](https://ukie.org.uk/news/2024/04/2023VideoGameIndustryValuation).

We aim to do this via the GameVault website (*Insert live link here*) and also through using store fronts on social media initially through our Facebook store, and eventually Instagram and TikTok, which we anticipate will help grow our brand awareness. With future plans of using influencer marketing, and partnerships within the gaming community.

We also anticipate additional sales from our exisiting customer base through the use of promotions and invitations to exclusive events offered exclusively via our newsletter.
