We craft out pizza sauce and dough every morning, then load up our mobile pizza truck and head out on the open road where we top and cook our pizzas to order on site. Wether that is at your front door, wedding venue, high street or charity event. If we can drive there, we can cook there. Our pizzas are cooked in a wood fired pizza oven in the back of our pizza truck to ensure that authentic pizza experience.

This project, based on a fictitous mobile pizza restaurant of my own deisgn but inspired by a company with a similar business model from the local area of my home town in Bristol. Is designed to allow customers to create and log into an account, and to book The Pizza Project mobile truck on a selected date, and have the option to leave a comment on their booking. As well as for the business owner to log into the website as the super user, to manage their bookings and menu.

## User Experience

### Strategy Plane

The primary site goal of GameVault, is to serve as a business to consumer website for a video game retailer. GameVault offers its customers a selection of video games and gaming accessories across all modern gaming consoles. Product inventory is categorised by console, and customers can filter products further by price and rating. Products images are displayed to show customers  of similar mobile pizza , a menu and a booking form that could be submitted by users following registering/logging into the website, where they could also edit and delete their booking providing the were still logged in.

## Skeleton Plane

## Surface Plane

Making use of Bootstrap 5.0, I chose to use the Grayscale bootstrap theme from StartBootstrap.com. This decision was made to help reduce the required amount of custom css and javascript that would normally be required.


## Features

- A navbar that provides direction to customers to all the pages across the site. Home, Menu, Enquiries, Profile, My Booking, Register, Log In and Log Out.


## Database Design

The database hosted by ElephantSQL, was designed to capture the essential information given by a user for the site with this particular business to consumer business model. These categories included: Console, Genre, Price. 

The plan for the data within the database was to have two seperate views, one for the logged in user so they can view and manage their own booking/s, and also one for the business owner to view all collective bookings from within that database.

## Technologies

- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- Python
- Django
- Bootstrap 5.0
- Postgre ElephantSQL to handle the inventory database
- Allauth for new user account registration
- Balsamiq wireframes
